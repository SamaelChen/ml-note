## Variable types and terminology

There are two main types of variables, one called *qualitative*, one is *quantitative*.

Qualitative variables are also referred to as *categorical* and *discrete* variables as well as *factor*.

When we predict qualitative outputs, we call it *classification*, and if the prediction outputs is quantitative it is *regression*.
